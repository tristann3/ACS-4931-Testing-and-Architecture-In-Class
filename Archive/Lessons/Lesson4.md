## Lists in Python

<code>my_list = [1,"candy",4.5]</code>
- mutable
- heterogeneous

<!-- > -->

## Accessing items

- Index or position
- Negative indexing
- Slicing

## Memory Behavior

- Contiguous block of memory
- Think of an array as a row of mailboxes with each having a unique integer address
- Same item storage size at each index

## The Idea of a List

- Lists are used to represent an ordered collection of objects.
- There are many ways to build a list
- In Python lists are actually built using dynamic arrays

<!-- > -->

## Static Arrays

- Static arrays are a direct representation of how memory is organized in physical RAM
- Can’t change size because their memory is allocated once as a single contiguous block
- However, we often do not know or cannot predict how many items we need to store...

## Dynamic Arrays

- Dynamic arrays can change size but still have to store their items in a static array of fixed size – indexes are marked as occupied or available
- When the static array is out of space we need to allocate a larger one and copy all existing items into it before we can append a new item
