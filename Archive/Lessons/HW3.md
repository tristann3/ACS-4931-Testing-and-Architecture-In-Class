# Hash Tables

The goal of this assignment is to complete the [hash table starter code](https://github.com/tech-at-du/CS-1.2-Intro-Data-Structures/blob/master/Code/hashtable.py) so that it is passing all tests in the [hash table test file](https://github.com/tech-at-du/CS-1.2-Intro-Data-Structures/blob/master/Code/hashtable_test.py).

In this assignment you will complete the following methods inside the hash table class:
- values(): returns all the values present in the hash table as a list
- length(): returns the number of key, values present in the hash table
- contains(): returns true if key is in the hash table, false if not
- get(): returns the value for the given key if present, key error if not
- set(): adds a new key,value to the hash table if not already present, if key is already present updates the value
- delete(): removes the given key value from the hash table
