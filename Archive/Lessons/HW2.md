# Linked Lists

The goal of this assignment is to complete the [linked list starter code](https://github.com/tech-at-du/CS-1.2-Intro-Data-Structures/blob/master/Code/linkedlist.py) so that it is passing all tests in the [linked list test file](https://github.com/tech-at-du/CS-1.2-Intro-Data-Structures/blob/master/Code/linkedlist_test.py).

In this assignment you will complete the following methods inside the linked list class:
- length(): the number of nodes in the linked list
- append(): inserts a new node at the tail of the linked list
- prepend(): inserts a new node at the head of the linked list
- find(): checks if data is present in the linked list
- delete(): deletes a given item from the linked list
